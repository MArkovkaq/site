<nav class="n">MONTE-CARLO MASTERS STAR’S 300,000 EURO WATCH STOLEN
</nav>
</div>
<div class="new">
  23 year-old Korda was understandably shocked, but not injured in the altercation, despite reports that the culprits allegedly belted the athlete before making a hasty escape on a moped.

The case of this stolen luxury watch was entrusted to teams from the Menton police station, who have started a forensic investigation at the scene of the crime. Both individuals involved in the theft are not yet known, but remain actively sought after.

To his credit, Korda overcame the unsavoury experience and went on to compete in the Masters tournament. However, the American athlete was eliminated by Italy’s Jannik Sinner in the second round of the tournament on Wednesday, April 10.

<nav class="n">MIKA HÄKKINEN’S VERY SPECIAL MCLAREN
TO GO ON AUCTION IN MONACO
</nav>
<div class="new">
 Further contributing to this very special lot’s appeal is Häkkinen’s offer of a private driving and racing session with the former F1 driver at a location of the lucky buyer’s choice.

A lot can be learned from the ‘Flying Finn’, who won the 1998 and 1999 world titles behind the wheel of a McLaren-Mercedes. Häkkinen took part in 130 Grand Prix for the McLaren team before he retired after the 2001 season, making Mika somewhat synonymous with the brand.

The VP3 was the first McLaren that Häkkinen ever owned, and served as the lead car in the P1 project’s durability testing program. A special booklet created by McLaren to outline the importance of this car as well as testing notes is included in the sale.

<nav class="n">KENNETH BLOM MAKES MONACO DEBUT
WITH ‘SILHOUETTES UNVEILED’
</nav>
<div class="new">
“This exhibition presents 18 versions of “I didn’t manage but I tried.” 

Modesty aside, Blom’s works are in high demand, admired and shown extensively around the world. 

The Oslo-based artist, who was born in Denmark and grew up in Norway, was always surrounded by art, as his father was a jeweller and designer. Blom attended the Oslo Academy of Fine Arts from 1990 to 1994 and completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Düssedorf in 1995. Since then, he has established himself as a modern Nordic contemporary artist in galleries worldwide. 

Silhouettes Unveiled are available to see and acquire at the Kamil Art Gallery in Monaco until Monday, April 22.
