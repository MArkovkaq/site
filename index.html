    MONTE-CARLO MASTERS STAR’S 
    300,000 EURO WATCH STOLEN
    <p class="text">America’s Sebastian Korda became the victim of theft, as his 300,000 euro Richard-Mille watch was stolen by two individuals when the tennis star was going down a staircase in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin two days before the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters was set to begin, in the later hours of Thursday, April 4.
23 year-old Korda was understandably shocked, but not injured in the altercation, despite reports that the culprits allegedly belted the athlete before making a hasty escape on a moped.</p>

  MIKA HÄKKINEN’S VERY SPECIAL MCLAREN 
    <br>TO GO ON AUCTION IN MONACO
    <br><p class="text">Two-time Formula 1 world champion and resident of the Principality Mika Häkkinen is parting ways with his exceedingly rare McLaren P1 test car, which is set to go under the hammer at Bonhams’ ‘Les Grandes Marques à Monaco’ auction on Friday, May 10.
McLaren built 375 P1 road cars, but only seven ‘Validation Prototype’ P1’s, of which this car is example number three, resulting in the rather straightforward ‘VP3’ name. This will be the only VP P1 to ever go on auction..</p>
